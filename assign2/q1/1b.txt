A scatter of points should be shown in the plot. 
Some points form horizontal and vertical lines. 
The sequence of random numbers generated by the formula is pseudorandom and may exhibit some correlations. 
The plot shows that there is no obvious relationship between the values in the sequence, which is a good thing for a random number generator.
